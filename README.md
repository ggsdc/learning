# Materials used to learn and practice

The aim of this repository is to collect a set of small examples and exercises that I have developed as an exercise to learn new topics or to refresh my knlowedge in them.

The repository is ordered by topics and by increasing difficulty exercises inside each topic. Some of the resources created in each exercise will be shared as the starting point for others, so there should be a lot of imports between exercises.

Each exercise will come with a small README file which will contain the explication of the aim of the topic to learn, an explanation of the code inside the script or scripts in the exercise and the results / analysis of the exercise.

The main topics are:

* [Machine learning]()
	* [EDA]()
	* [Regression]()
	* [Classification]()
	* [Clustering]()
	* [Feature engenieering]()
	* [Deep Learning]()
* [Optimization]():
	* [Linear programming]()
	* [Mixed integer programming]()
	* [Non linear programming]()
	* [Heuristics]()
	* [Metaheuristics]()
* [Reinforcement Learning]()
* And many more...
